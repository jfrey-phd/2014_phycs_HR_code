// Replace constuctor of Client to register by itself the socket and not print the stack trace if an exception occurs. It's damn a dirty workaround (static method called upon call to constructor...)

// WARNING: in the end the object may not have the exact same internal state as if Client is directly used (eg: disconnectEvent, also "host" variables kind)

// FIXME: could be hard to maintain with new versions of processing. Here Client.java of 2.1.2 was examined. Good idea to look into https://github.com/processing/processing/blob/master/java/libraries/net/src/processing/net/Client.java
