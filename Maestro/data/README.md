 
Body parts for constructing agents. Filename design their type, layers the animations.

Each layer id *must* be named "layerX", with x ranging from 1 to N in linear order. If not "layer1" is founds, nothing will be loaded.

Caution: you may need to edit XML source manually to set id, eg inkscape GUI set only "inkscape:label" field.
